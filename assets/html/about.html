    <h2 style="font-family: Coming Soon">General Information</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Coming Soon">
      The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
      residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
      learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
      ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by o
      small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
      parents and previous league members.
